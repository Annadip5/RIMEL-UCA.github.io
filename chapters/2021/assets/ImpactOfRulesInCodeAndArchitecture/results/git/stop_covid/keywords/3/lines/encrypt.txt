./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:28:52208,Clear JSON?,Is there anything to encrypt JSON data?
./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:32:An end-to-end encryption based on:
./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:38:JSON can be encrypted with these shared keys.

./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:165:52936,RSSI calibration can be used to track users,I believe rawRSSI and calibratedRSSI are broadcast in clear. From what I understand this value is only of 8bits precision, however this can still be used to track a device since the calibration value for a device remains constant. A typical application would be a shopping center using it to track people walking around. These values should be encrypted.,[]
