./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:172:52831,REST server is leaking monitoring data,It's really cool that you started using Spring Boot Actuator to monitor your data (it wasn't the case a couple of days ago!), but as you don't use Spring Security, this means the monitoring endpoints are available to the outside world.

./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:443:A bit of context of this bug: I discovered this while examining the Australian contact tracing app COVIDSafe (that's also affected). Only recently I thought of checking other related apps and discovered that TousAntiCovid suffered the same issue. For some reason I previously thought TousAntiCovid (or StopCovid) did not use a connectable advertisement (as it seems that the payload is embedded in the advertisement data -- why do you still need to make the advertisement connectable?). Samsung has said they have no plan to fix this bug.,[]
