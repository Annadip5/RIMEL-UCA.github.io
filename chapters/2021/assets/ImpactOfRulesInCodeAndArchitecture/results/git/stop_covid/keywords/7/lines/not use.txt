./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:9:52048,Cryptographic key erasure,[SSUBuilder](https://gitlab.inria.fr/stopcovid19/stopcovid-robertsdk-android/-/blob/master/domain/src/main/java/com/lunabeestudio/domain/model/SSUBuilder.kt) and [HelloBuilder](https://gitlab.inria.fr/stopcovid19/stopcovid-robertsdk-android/-/blob/master/domain/src/main/java/com/lunabeestudio/domain/model/HelloBuilder.kt) hold a key created with SecretKeySpec. As stated in this documentation : [SecreyKeySpec constructor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/spec/SecretKeySpec.html#SecretKeySpec-byte:A-java.lang.String-) the key given in parameter to the SecretKeySpec constructor is copied into the new object, so this object should be cleaned by a call to [destroy](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/security/auth/Destroyable.html#destroy--) when not used anymore. **NB IMPORTANT : a test (during the test stage) should be done to make sure that the original key, given in the constructor parameter, is not erased consistently with the java api documentation**. 
./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:11:More broadly the arrays containing the shared key (or other secrets) should be overwritten as soon as they are not used anymore.,[]
./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:81:* why not use an uninhabited type like an empty enum (enum with no cases) in **RBConstants.swift** to prevent instantiations of the `RBConstants` type ?
./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:443:A bit of context of this bug: I discovered this while examining the Australian contact tracing app COVIDSafe (that's also affected). Only recently I thought of checking other related apps and discovered that TousAntiCovid suffered the same issue. For some reason I previously thought TousAntiCovid (or StopCovid) did not use a connectable advertisement (as it seems that the payload is embedded in the advertisement data -- why do you still need to make the advertisement connectable?). Samsung has said they have no plan to fix this bug.,[]
./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:595:58374,APK install - Certificate issue?,Hello, I do not use the Google Play Store, instead I download the APK (last: 1.1.3) from https://bonjour.stopcovid.gouv.fr/ . Thanks for that!
