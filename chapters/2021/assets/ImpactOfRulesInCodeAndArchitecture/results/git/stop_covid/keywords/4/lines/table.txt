./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:181:That's the "@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)" annotation that saves everything that has been changed in the audit table, as well as a timestamp.
./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:437:62889,CVE-2020-35693,Hi, I'd just like to point out a recent CVE (CVE-2020-35693) that may affect TousAntiCovid (Android version). It is a firmware bug (or 'feature', depending on who you ask) affecting Samsung mobile devices running Android 7.1.1 or earlier, allowing anyone to pair with a vulnerable device if the device is advertising a connectable GATT service (just like TousAntiCovid does). 
./results/git/stop_covid/issue_file_gitlab.txt:443:A bit of context of this bug: I discovered this while examining the Australian contact tracing app COVIDSafe (that's also affected). Only recently I thought of checking other related apps and discovered that TousAntiCovid suffered the same issue. For some reason I previously thought TousAntiCovid (or StopCovid) did not use a connectable advertisement (as it seems that the payload is embedded in the advertisement data -- why do you still need to make the advertisement connectable?). Samsung has said they have no plan to fix this bug.,[]
