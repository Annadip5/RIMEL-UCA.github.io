./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:281:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-server/issues/52,Sorry for the necromancy comment, but thanks to your link to https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform/issues/23, I've managed to solve the same [issue](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-devops/commit/cc6fadb889fd3013fb9d0844716b50128e987f8e). In a very random note, at [HOPR](https://hoprnet.org/) we are building an open-source privacy-oriented mixnet to communicate data and we might overlap with some of the work done in here. HMU here or at Twitter w/@jjperezaguinaga (or our founder @SCBuergel) in Twitter to chat ☺️ 
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:341:No harm, no foul. We're admittedly all pretty absorbed in this project, and we do appreciate any feedback to make it easier for folks to understand, and especially as it relates to privacy, and peoples trust and confidence in the service.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:414:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/10,The more I browse through changes from the original design, the less confident I get from this forked development. There is a reason Google and Apple developed specific guidelines and changing them to "adapt" to local health care needs is only making it more vulnerable to various privacy issues.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:425:If you want to change how it behaves, you should submit your changes to Google, so they adapt their code under their security practices and guidelines. Taking a secure server and changing it up to make it more "convenient" for various local parties is how security and privacy breaches are created. 
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:427:At the very least you should commission Google folks to review your changes and provide their guidance in terms of security and privacy. 
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:428:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/10,For what it's worth, it wasn't Google that developed the upstream pre-fork codebase. That was built, as a reference implementation of Apple/Google's Exposure Notification frameworks, prospectively for an ultimate handoff to CDS or some other Canadian government entity, and in as simple and privacy-preserving a manner as possible. Changes and improvements are being made here, post-handoff, rather than in the upstream repo, because the project also took on a life of its own outside of Canada and it's much simpler for CDS to not worry about conflicting with those other users while prioritizing getting COVID Alert working for Canada. We do actually intend to take most or all of these changes upstream, but just haven't got around to it yet. Speaking as a maintainer of one part of that upstream project, I can safely say that I haven't come across a change in this fork that I haven't found completely compatible with our original privacy stance and vision.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:433:The app will be used only if people have confidence in privacy features of the app and so far statements like "random identifiers" are misleading because if they were random, you wouldn't be able to receive a diagnosis key, which is a daily key and match it up against rolling proximity identifiers.
