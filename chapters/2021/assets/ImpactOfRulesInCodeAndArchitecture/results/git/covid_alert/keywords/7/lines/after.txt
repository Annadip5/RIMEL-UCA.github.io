./results/git/covid_alert/issue_file_github.txt:348:This issue was easily demonstrated with an HTTP server that sends response data that contains 100 bytes of zeros data back to the client in response to the POST /claim-key request. The POST request is sent when the user enters the 8-digit number to initiate the uploading of TEKs, after being diagnosed.  Because the app thinks the response is valid, it displays the "Agree" screen to request user's permission to download the TEKs.  When the user selects Agree, an error message is returned, "Random codes could not be uploaded You did not give permission".  The application is not able to recover and is stuck in the "upload your random codes" state.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_file_github.txt:513:1178,[BVC-158] Keys should be wiped after leaving diagnosed state.,# Summary | Résumé
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_file_github.txt:515:Keys created during the initial OTK exchange step are not removed from local storage after leaving the diagnosed state. As a matter of keeping things clean, would recommend wiping any artifacts related to previous diagnosis state.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_file_github.txt:658:However, for the OTK SMS, we just send the OTK without any text around or after it. This means that both of our Notify SMS templates are identical, so it would be better to have just 1 template rather than 2. Code that you're not using for anything just makes the app bigger and harder to maintain.
