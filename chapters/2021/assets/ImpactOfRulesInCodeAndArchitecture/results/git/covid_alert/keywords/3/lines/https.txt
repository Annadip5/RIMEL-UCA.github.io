There is a reason Google and Apple developed specific guidelines and changing them to "adapt" to local health care needs is only making it more vulnerable to various privacy issues.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:428:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/10,For what it's worth, it wasn't Google that developed the upstream pre-fork codebase. That was built, as a reference implementation of Apple/Google's Exposure Notification frameworks, prospectively for an ultimate handoff to CDS or some other Canadian government entity, and in as simple and privacy-preserving a manner as possible. Changes and improvements are being made here, post-handoff, rather than in the upstream repo, because the project also took on a life of its own outside of Canada and it's much simpler for CDS to not worry about conflicting with those other users while prioritizing getting COVID Alert working for Canada. We do actually intend to take most or all of these changes upstream, but just haven't got around to it yet. Speaking as a maintainer of one part of that upstream project, I can safely say that I haven't come across a change in this fork that I haven't found completely compatible with our original privacy stance and vision.

./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:448:Most of what you're asking for is actually the domain of the Exposure Notification frameworks in Android and iOS. While it's true that COVID Shield and COVID Alert would do well to explain this integrated system of app and framework holistically, the reason the early documentation doesn't have the information you're looking to find is that the framework parts are extensively documented in a more global way ([example](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing), [example](https://ncase.me/contact-tracing/)). The truly novel parts of the app and server are few and far between; the mobile application is, to a larger extent than one would initially guess, just a pretty wrapper around a small handful of framework calls. The One-Time-Code system for authenticating diagnoses is really the only major concept not defined by Apple and Google.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:451:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/48,Your suggestion cannot be implemented within the Google/Apple framework since the framework requires explicit consent from the user (via a dialog box) before exposures are uploaded.

Improved support for BC will most likely also require improvement in the process of managing new requirements such as better tracking/sign off of requirements of both BC Heath and Canada Health authorities discussed strictly privately so far (no public records readily available). https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-server/issues/417 has been entered to track progress on managing new requirements and getting them allocated for development, testing and release -vs- other resources currently available or already allocated.

Two additional sub-reqs: 1) Tracking as proximity events non signatory QR scan code sites would have merits for an app user wishing to track their whereabouts (without depending on Google map trace). Would be useful before more comprehensive support gets off the ground, likely involving bureaucratic delays. 2) Make sure the feature can be individually activated and deactivated, similarly to activating/deactivating Bluetooth proximity events, and log these commands to the Google setting log.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:475:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/48,An elegant user interface scheme to implement pre-authorization would be through an activation and deactivation command of the actual alert notification. So once the user signs up to be notified upon diagnosed exposure events (whether bluetooth proximity or QR code scan), he/she also signs up to notify (preauthorize) if ever diagnosed. Fair is fair? Activation of notification inbound is currently defaulted on while outbound notification is on-demand voluntary, and too often avoided which defeats entire purpose of the app. @sidewalkballet

There is a reason Google and Apple developed specific guidelines and changing them to "adapt" to local health care needs is only making it more vulnerable to various privacy issues.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:905:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/10,For what it's worth, it wasn't Google that developed the upstream pre-fork codebase. That was built, as a reference implementation of Apple/Google's Exposure Notification frameworks, prospectively for an ultimate handoff to CDS or some other Canadian government entity, and in as simple and privacy-preserving a manner as possible. Changes and improvements are being made here, post-handoff, rather than in the upstream repo, because the project also took on a life of its own outside of Canada and it's much simpler for CDS to not worry about conflicting with those other users while prioritizing getting COVID Alert working for Canada. We do actually intend to take most or all of these changes upstream, but just haven't got around to it yet. Speaking as a maintainer of one part of that upstream project, I can safely say that I haven't come across a change in this fork that I haven't found completely compatible with our original privacy stance and vision.

./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:919:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/10,Of course security audits are important (and, if you peruse the closed issues on these repositories, you'll see quite a bit of activity of that nature).
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:925:Most of what you're asking for is actually the domain of the Exposure Notification frameworks in Android and iOS. While it's true that COVID Shield and COVID Alert would do well to explain this integrated system of app and framework holistically, the reason the early documentation doesn't have the information you're looking to find is that the framework parts are extensively documented in a more global way ([example](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing), [example](https://ncase.me/contact-tracing/)). The truly novel parts of the app and server are few and far between; the mobile application is, to a larger extent than one would initially guess, just a pretty wrapper around a small handful of framework calls. The One-Time-Code system for authenticating diagnoses is really the only major concept not defined by Apple and Google.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:928:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/48,Your suggestion cannot be implemented within the Google/Apple framework since the framework requires explicit consent from the user (via a dialog box) before exposures are uploaded. There is nothing the app can do here to automate this process.

Improved support for BC will most likely also require improvement in the process of managing new requirements such as better tracking/sign off of requirements of both BC Heath and Canada Health authorities discussed strictly privately so far (no public records readily available). https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-server/issues/417 has been entered to track progress on managing new requirements and getting them allocated for development, testing and release -vs- other resources currently available or already allocated. More resources and budget may be necessary in order to timely deliver during the 2nd wave.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:940:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/42,This is a public repo. I feel that if the BC gov were more public with their requirements, BC tech firms would be happy to contribute coding resources to solve these problems. It's the lack of transparency when journalists asks questions about their progress that is most upsetting. I would invite Dr Bonnie Hendry and Health Minister Adrian Dix to consider posting the requirements to this issue to improve the transparency of the process.

./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:951:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/44,Still not sure on process to exchange on related requirements. Two additional sub-reqs: 1) Tracking as proximity events non signatory QR scan code sites would have merits for an app user wishing to track their whereabouts (without depending on Google map trace). Would be useful before more comprehensive support gets off the ground, likely involving bureaucratic delays. 2) Make sure the feature can be individually activated and deactivated, similarly to activating/deactivating Bluetooth proximity events, and log these commands to the Google setting log.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:952:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/48,An elegant user interface scheme to implement pre-authorization would be through an activation and deactivation command of the actual alert notification. So once the user signs up to be notified upon diagnosed exposure events (whether bluetooth proximity or QR code scan), he/she also signs up to notify (preauthorize) if ever diagnosed. Fair is fair? Activation of notification inbound is currently defaulted on while outbound notification is on-demand voluntary, and too often avoided which defeats entire purpose of the app. @sidewalkballet
