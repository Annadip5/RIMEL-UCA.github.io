./results/git/covid_alert/commit_file_github.txt:270:* removed unnecessary code
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:197:It's your call really, right now the code looks like `code|cut:" "|length` so I wouldn't call this really complicated. That exact wording might not even be necessary in the future.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:295:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-server/issues/69,I'm not sure this is necessary: the only files sent are zip files, which are already compressed, and tiny JSON blobs which are unlikely to be more than 1–2 packets anyway.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:462:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/42,Further thread discussions have not timely occured. Improved support for BC will most likely also require improvement in the process of managing new requirements such as better tracking/sign off of requirements of both BC Heath and Canada Health authorities discussed strictly privately so far (no public records readily available). https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-server/issues/417 has been entered to track progress on managing new requirements and getting them allocated for development, testing and release -vs- other resources currently available or already allocated. More resources and budget may be necessary in order to timely deliver during the 2nd wave.
