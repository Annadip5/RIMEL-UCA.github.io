./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:428:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/issues/10,For what it's worth, it wasn't Google that developed the upstream pre-fork codebase. That was built, as a reference implementation of Apple/Google's Exposure Notification frameworks, prospectively for an ultimate handoff to CDS or some other Canadian government entity, and in as simple and privacy-preserving a manner as possible. Changes and improvements are being made here, post-handoff, rather than in the upstream repo, because the project also took on a life of its own outside of Canada and it's much simpler for CDS to not worry about conflicting with those other users while prioritizing getting COVID Alert working for Canada. We do actually intend to take most or all of these changes upstream, but just haven't got around to it yet. Speaking as a maintainer of one part of that upstream project, I can safely say that I haven't come across a change in this fork that I haven't found completely compatible with our original privacy stance and vision.
