Looking at the string length give you `9` because of the space in the middle, so it's probably better to keep the number hardcoded for now.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:194:https://api.github.com/repos/cds-snc/covid-alert-portal/issues/38,@PierrePaul Merci pour le PR! My initial reaction is to suspect that since the 8 digit code won't change in size that we can keep it hardcoded. Just really to keep things as simple as possible, what do you think?

./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:241:It's worth keeping in mind that when something is predicted to happen in x minutes, or is a log of what happened x minutes ago, you can use UTC timestamps (or UNIX timestamps) to represent these instants in time. Where you can't use UNIX timestamps is when humans are trying to arrange a time to meet in a certain location's time zone (because time zones vary over time and place), but when minutes get leap seconds added to them, the duration of a minute changes in every time zone -- such that generally speaking, 10 minutes from now in UTC is equivalent to 10 minutes from now in a local time zone. :)
