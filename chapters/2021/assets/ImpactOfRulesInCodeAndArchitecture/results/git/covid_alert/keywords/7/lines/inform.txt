./results/git/covid_alert/issue_comment_file_github.txt:448:Most of what you're asking for is actually the domain of the Exposure Notification frameworks in Android and iOS. While it's true that COVID Shield and COVID Alert would do well to explain this integrated system of app and framework holistically, the reason the early documentation doesn't have the information you're looking to find is that the framework parts are extensively documented in a more global way ([example](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing), [example](https://ncase.me/contact-tracing/)). The truly novel parts of the app and server are few and far between; the mobile application is, to a larger extent than one would initially guess, just a pretty wrapper around a small handful of framework calls. The One-Time-Code system for authenticating diagnoses is really the only major concept not defined by Apple and Google.

The COVID alert text is larger, but at least for how I prefer my phone to be set up, the text is unnecessarily large and this can impact information density.
