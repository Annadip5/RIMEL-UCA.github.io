In a very random note, at [HOPR](https://hoprnet.org/) we are building an open-source privacy-oriented mixnet to communicate data and we might overlap with some of the work done in here.

./results/git/covid_alert/issue_file_github.txt:722:This caused an issue where deleted OTKs were being counted multiple times. The issue has been resolved by using transactions but this caused a small increase in the number of DB connections needed. 
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_file_github.txt:859:<li><a href="https://github.com/npm/ini/commit/2da90391ef70db41d10f013e3a87f9a8c5d01a72"><code>2da9039</code></a> 1.3.6</li>
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_file_github.txt:938:378,Remove transactions from db.saveEvent,## Description
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_file_github.txt:940:The private method [persistence.saveEvent](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-server/blob/93db46640ecebcb23acfbcf6cef69c9d662aab48/pkg/persistence/events.go#L83) should not run in a transaction since it's usually run from within a transaction because transactions cannot be nested in MySQL, so either we are commiting too early or golang is just ignore the nest.
./results/git/covid_alert/issue_file_github.txt:942:The public method [persistence.SaveEvent](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-server/blob/93db46640ecebcb23acfbcf6cef69c9d662aab48/pkg/persistence/events.go#L75) should have the transaction instead.
