./results/git/covid_alert/issue_file_github.txt:536:The startKeysSubmission and performExposureStatusUpdate functions are able to modify the shared ExposureStatus variable without any concurrency control in place. This could result in one function overwriting the value set by another function before either function completes. It can result in the state of 'exposed' getting overwritten to 'diagnosed' and vice versa and prematurely stopping further processing of a diagnosis file upload or exposure matching.
