App transport security fix (#1449)

* Update fastlane to 2.176.0 (was 2.174.0) - also updates
aws-partitions 1.429.0 (was 1.427.0)
aws-sdk-s3 1.89.0 (was 1.88.1)
emoji_regex 3.2.2 (was 3.2.1)

* Add a new fastlane lane that checks to see that there is no NSAppTransportSecurity key in the final IPA
This check is only performed when a :build_and_deploy with production. This action can be triggered by the yarn deploy-ios:production action. @cds-snc team need to confirm if this is sufficient for checking the build that will end up in the appstore

feat: re-enable v2 (#426)
fix: only count OTKs if deletions actually occured

Fixes:
This is a further fix to correct the way OTK's are counted

Only persist counts for OTKExpired, OTKExhausted, OTKExpiredNoUploads and OTKUnclaimed if a deletion actually occurs. 

This PR also fixes a small potential bug where SQL Queries are using fmt.sprintf that can potentially allow a sql injection attack if someone was able to modify our Server Secrets. Although if that were to occur we would have significantly greater problems then a sql injection. This is just closing up a small issue.
feat: re-enable v2 (#421)
Fix/transaction count (#420)

Breaks up the expiration worker deletion so it now counts and deletes Expired, Exhausted, and Unclaimed OTKs separately. 

The count and deletion now occur in a transaction this should prevent the race condition that was previously found in this worker.
