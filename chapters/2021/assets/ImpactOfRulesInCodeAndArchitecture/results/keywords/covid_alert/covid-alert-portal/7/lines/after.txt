/mnt/c/Users/conig/Desktop/test/covid-alert-portal/README.md:217:Feature development on the Portal follows a [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) workflow. The `main` branch has the most up-to-date code and is always production-ready. When starting a new feature (or a bugfix, etc.), a new branch is created from the tip of the `main` branch. Once the work is complete, the feature is merged back into `main` via a Pull Request (PR). PRs must pass a series of [automated tests](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-portal#automated-tests) (unit tests, linting, etc), as well as a manual review by another developer. After the automated tests pass and the PR is approved, the code is merged into `main` and the feature branch is deleted. The `main` branch is protected from direct pushes or force pushes — pull requests are mandatory.
