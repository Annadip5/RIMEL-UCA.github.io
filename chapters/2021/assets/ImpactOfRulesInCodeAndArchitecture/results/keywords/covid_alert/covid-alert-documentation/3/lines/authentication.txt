./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:143:When a PT requests a one-time key so that it can be provided to the user, the PT system to obtain the key needs to prove to the key server that it is legitimate – i.e. that the PT system is run by a PT healthcare provider. To manage this authentication, the key server uses API tokens. Each API token is a random alphanumeric string of at least 20 characters, generated by CDS. CDS generates an API token for each PT system integrating with the key server to obtain one-time keys. The PT system provides that API token to the key server when requesting a one-time key.

CDS generates an API token for each PT system integrating with the key server to obtain one-time keys. The PT system provides that API token to the key server when requesting a one-time key. The API token cannot be linked to other information to identify an individual as it is meant to authenticate a PT system requesting a one-time key. A portion of the API token is stored alongside both one-time key entries and diagnosis keys during the 15-day period they are kept. In theory, this could be used to erase a set of keys that were uploaded maliciously if an API token given to a PT were compromised. It could also be used to help generate metrics per region to estimate uptake versus the number of published COVID cases. For example, we are currently disaggregating the one-time keys by province for server metrics, to know the number of one-time keys that were submitted by the province or territory. [↩](#f2)
