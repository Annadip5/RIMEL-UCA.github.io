./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:51:CDS is responsible for providing internal support services (information technology services) to Health Canada. It is responsible for developing the technological components of the exposure notification app. In addition to developing the app itself, CDS operates the Government of Canada key server (located within Canada) that stores encrypted diagnosis keys that reflect positive COVID-19 cases. The key server operates on a cloud solution procured via Shared Services Canada cloud brokering service. CDS also provides support to PT partners as they integrate one-time key distribution into their result notification processes. This includes providing PTs access to one-time keys that users will enter into the app if they receive a positive diagnosis, through an API or a federally-run portal for authorized healthcare professionals.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:147:As described in section 5, the one-time key exists for the purpose of allowing users (who are provided the key by their province) to upload their diagnosis keys to the server, acting as an anti-spam measure to ensure fake diagnosis keys are not accidentally or maliciously uploaded. The diagnosis keys are not associated with the one-time key or uploaded to the server along with the key. Once the key is entered in the app by the user, it is sent directly from the app to the key server, and it’s not retained in the app. The key server then checks to see if that one-time key is valid or not. If it’s valid, the key server erases its record of the one-time key and allows the app to upload the device’s diagnosis keys, with the user’s consent, by exchanging an encryption keypair with the app to ensure the diagnosis keys are encrypted in transit. Thus, as noted, the one-time key is not associated with the uploaded diagnosis keys. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:167:When the test results system of a PT using this feature reaches out to the Government of Canada key server to obtain a one-time key, it passes along a cryptographically-generated HashID, generated using a series of one-way hashing algorithms. The HashID is generated by the PT based on unique data elements under their control, but hashed in such a way that when it is given to the Government of Canada, it is meaningless.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:175:Data is collected from COVID Alert to enable HC to better measure and encourage app uptake, and monitor its performance and effectiveness in limiting the spread of COVID-19. The data used to develop metrics are collected by creating event logs of user experiences and/or actions. These event logs are transmitted to the key server and will be accompanied by the IP address; however, the event logs and the IP address will not be linkable and will never be stored together. The data will be encrypted in transit and stored in two ways on the key server: 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:186:PTs will be expected to use sufficiently strong cryptographic hashing algorithms (implementing appropriate security measures will form part of the agreements with the provinces), so that the Government of Canada is unable to identify somebody with the HashID. Furthermore, it cannot be linked with any data in Government of Canada possession to determine whether somebody had uploaded diagnosis keys or not.

./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:522:Data is collected from COVID Alert to develop the app metrics that enable HC to assess app effectiveness and performance. The data used to develop the app metrics are collected by creating event logs of user experiences and/or actions.

The data will be encrypted in transit and stored in two ways on the key server: 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:599:*   number of unclaimed encryption keys, by PT (an encryption key is what you get in return for claiming an OTK, so this metric represents number of unclaimed OTKs)

De plus, il ne peut être relié à aucune donnée en possession du gouvernement du Canada pour déterminer si quelqu’un a téléchargé ou non des clés de diagnostic.
