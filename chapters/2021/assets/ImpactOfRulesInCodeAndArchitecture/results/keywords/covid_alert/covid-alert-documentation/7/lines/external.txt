./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:285:The app and its development is being implemented primarily by developers, designers, and researchers employed directly by the Government of Canada whose security clearance level is commensurate with the level of access they have. When external support is brought in on an advisory capacity (e.g., BlackBerry reviewing source code on a pro bono basis), it is without access to the system data. The code and infrastructure can be reviewed without providing any access to the data. When external support is brought in on a more hands-on capacity (e.g., developers with specialized mobile app or server infrastructure skills to ensure security and reliability at scale), those individuals will be under contract (either through procurement or through mechanisms like Interchange) which ensure they are held to the same standards as those employed directly by the Government of Canada. Security clearances will be required for anyone with access to sensitive infrastructure or data.
