./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:15:* [Appendix A: List of COVID Alert App Data](#appendix-a-list-of-covid-alert-app-data)
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:25:This assessment will examine the privacy implications of the app, specifically in relation to the information/data that will be under the control of the Government of Canada, including the data that will be transmitted to the Government of Canada Server (key server). It will not examine any information under the control of the Provinces/Territories (PTs), such as the mechanism through which one-time keys are distributed to individuals for PTs who distribute one-time keys themselves.<sup id="f1">[[1]](#otp-portal)</sup> 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:27:Certain processes that occur at the PT level, on a device, or to and from a device, where the Government of Canada will not have access to any of the data, are described in this assessment in order to depict the complete flow of information, even though this data is not considered to be under the control of the Government of Canada. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:33:Exposure notification is considered to be a minimally intrusive approach intended to be used in combination with and in support of current public health measures being taken across Canada in response to the pandemic. COVID Alert takes a fully de-centralized approach in which personally identifiable information is not being collected and stored in a single central location. Instead, when a user downloads the app and consents to its various functions, their mobile device transmits random IDs that are used to record proximity to another app user’s smart phone. This differs from contact tracing apps which access a device’s location data and report it to public health authorities. More information on how the app works is provided in section 5 of this document. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:39:Each PT has the option to adopt the app for its jurisdiction. No data from any pre-existing exposure notification/contact tracing apps PTs may already have in place will be transferred to the national COVID-19 exposure notification app. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:65:Google/Apple jointly developed the exposure notification API being adopted, subject to [Google](https://blog.google/documents/72/Exposure_Notifications_Service_Additional_Terms.pdf) and [Apple’s](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/download/Exposure_Notification_Addendum.pdf) terms and conditions, by the Government of Canada for the COVID Alert app.  Google and Apple do not have access to the data. CDS consults Google and Apple when new operating system or framework changes are published by both companies.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:73:BlackBerry has provided support in an advisory capacity to review the security of the source code on a pro bono basis. They were given read-only access to CDS source code and testing infrastructure for the explicit purposes of discovering vulnerabilities and/or weaknesses in our implementation. At no point did or does BlackBerry have or require any access to data in order to conduct its security audit. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:83:Users voluntarily download the app from the Google Play store or Apple IOS store onto their device and provide consent to participate in the exposure notification process. More specifically, they are required to review and accept a clear and accessible statement that provides them with information about how the app works, how information about exposure will be received by the user and transmitted to other users, what data will be collected about them and how that data will be used and where it will be stored. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:85:Downloading and installing the app does not initiate the exposure notification process. When a user first opens the app, they are presented a walkthrough of how exposure notifications work and what data is shared. They are then asked if they wish to enable exposure notifications. A consent dialog from their device’s operating system appears. If they enable exposure notifications, the Google/Apple API exposure notification “layer” (GAOS layer) of the device is activated. This also initiates activation of the device’s Bluetooth function so that the device begins sending signals to and receiving signals from the devices of other users who have downloaded the app. This Bluetooth communication between participating users is short-range device-to-device communication; nothing is being transmitted to any server. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:87:The design of the Google/Apple API is such that this protected layer of the operating system is isolated, so no other app on the device can access its data, and even the exposure notification app can only access the data through explicit user consent. Only one app per device can access the Google/Apple layer, and only one app per geographical region is permitted.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:93:The daily TEK generation and frequent RPI generation are design features with the purpose of minimizing the risk of re-identification of users. (In addition to this, they are designed to minimize data transfer to conserve bandwidth.) The RPIs are not identifiable and are not accessible to the app or transmitted to the key server. By design, the RPIs are meant to be public (they are shared to other devices via Bluetooth), and as such do not provide any form of identifying information in the absence of other information. Even if an RPI were intercepted by a device operated by a malicious actor, it would be an entirely meaningless number, and would not be linkable to a device without significant effort. TEKs are stored on the device, but may only be released to the key server in the case of a positive test result and explicit user consent.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:123:### Is There a Collection of Personal Information/Data?
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:125:The data elements (see [Appendix A](#appendix-a-list-of-covid-alert-app-data)) that will be under the control of the Government of Canada and stored in the Government of Canada key server (located in Canada) do not contain any direct identifiers (e.g. name, identifying numbers, etc.). 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:145:PTs can also generate one-time keys using a healthcare portal operated by the Government of Canada. In this case, healthcare workers who have been authorized by the PT can log in to a secure portal, managed by CDS. This healthcare portal does not contain any patient data and is only used to generate one-time keys, which it retrieves via API from the key server. PTs are responsible for designating officials in their healthcare organizations who can serve as administrators of the portal and manage user accounts for their PT.<sup id="f8">[[8]](#healthcare-portal-privacy)</sup>
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:149:Users have the option to enter the date of symptom onset or test date in order to refine the exposure notifications to users who were in close contact with a positive case during the period they were the most infectious. Although this data is not uploaded to the server, it’s theoretically possible to calculate the number of TEKs uploaded per event based on the size of the upload, and reverse-engineer a probable date of symptom onset or test based on that information and the log timestamp. Even if a probable date were reverse-engineered, the risk of re-identification remains low, as this would require effort and access equal to what would be needed to link a positive diagnosis to a specific IP address (more on IP addresses to follow). As well, even if this could be done, it is impossible to know which date it is – date of symptom onset or test date.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:155:The IP address accompanies any request made to the key server (e.g., when a user chooses to upload their random codes, or enters their one-time key). However, the IP address is not intentionally “sent” by the app. It accompanies the request naturally: IP addresses are metadata required as part of the underlying internet protocol that powers data transmission over the Internet; without this, the app and the server would not be able to communicate. In other words, IP addresses accompany _all_ requests made to the server (one-time key generation, one-time key verification, diagnosis key upload, etc.). In most cases, the IP is not of the phone in particular, but of a wireless router or is dynamically assigned by a cellular network carrier. Few people have static IPs that are permanently associable to them, due to the limited number of IPv4 IP addresses. In sending that information, the IP accompanies the request, as with any request sent over the internet. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:159:IP addresses are stored in access logs on the AWS server, which is separate from the key server, for 3 months for all logs, and up to 24 months for those implicated in a security investigation, for cyber security systems to adequately understand, monitor, and respond to attacks against a system and for the secure and reliable operation of the service. Furthermore, IP addresses are not used by CDS to identify the source in any way, and they are not associated with any other data element in the server. The IP addresses are collected for security purposes. They are not used by the CDS-operated system to try to identify the source. IP addresses may be disclosed to law enforcement in the event a malicious actor attempted to gain, or gained, access to the server where they are stored. They would be deleted along with other data once the exposure notification system is shut down (i.e., once the pandemic is declared over), unless they are being retained for a security investigation.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:167:When the test results system of a PT using this feature reaches out to the Government of Canada key server to obtain a one-time key, it passes along a cryptographically-generated HashID, generated using a series of one-way hashing algorithms. The HashID is generated by the PT based on unique data elements under their control, but hashed in such a way that when it is given to the Government of Canada, it is meaningless.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:175:Data is collected from COVID Alert to enable HC to better measure and encourage app uptake, and monitor its performance and effectiveness in limiting the spread of COVID-19. The data used to develop metrics are collected by creating event logs of user experiences and/or actions. These event logs are transmitted to the key server and will be accompanied by the IP address; however, the event logs and the IP address will not be linkable and will never be stored together. The data will be encrypted in transit and stored in two ways on the key server: 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:184:In terms of security risk, someone with direct, server/database-level access to PT healthcare systems (healthcare worker, an IT person, or a malicious actor who’d broken into those systems) could determine whether or not a specific person who received a positive diagnosis had then decided to upload diagnosis keys. They could not track which diagnosis keys a patient subsequently uploaded.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:186:PTs will be expected to use sufficiently strong cryptographic hashing algorithms (implementing appropriate security measures will form part of the agreements with the provinces), so that the Government of Canada is unable to identify somebody with the HashID. Furthermore, it cannot be linked with any data in Government of Canada possession to determine whether somebody had uploaded diagnosis keys or not.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:188:#### Conclusion: Is There a Collection of Personal Information/Data?
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:190:We recognize that there is no such thing as zero risk when data is being released, and the only way to reduce the risk of releasing data to zero is to not release any data at all. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:192:We also acknowledge the position taken by multiple leading Privacy Regulators that assessing re-identification risk should look not only at the data itself, but also at the context in which the data are shared.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:203:Considering this data personal information would necessitate automatically considering data with any _de minimus_ risk of re-identification (rather than a serious risk of re-identification, defined as more than frivolous) as personal information, regardless of context. In our view, in this context, this data remains below the threshold of “serious risk of re-identification.”
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:205:Further, the Federal Court in Sig Sauer (Canada (Information Commissioner) v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 1279) found that “to use the serial numbers identify an individual would require either access to restricted government databases that already contain personal information, or a successful effort to trick either the government or the manufacturer into releasing personal information. The evidence does not establish a serious possibility of either occurring.” In this case, McHaffie J was satisfied that there was no personal information at issue.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:211:In conclusion given the totality of the circumstances, while the data elements exchanged by the app, the central key server and the PT servers could be used in theory to produce personally identifiable information, the measures taken in developing the app, the central key server, and PT servers, in addition to the manner in which they collect, exchange, use and retain these data elements, reduce the risk to the lowest minimum possible. Our overall assessment is that it is so highly unlikely that an individual could be identified, that the collection of data elements (including IP addresses) and how they are used does not meet the threshold of “serious possibility” that an individual could be identified.<sup id="f9">[[9]](#gordon)</sup>
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:213:Nevertheless, should a different conclusion be reached regarding the assessment of whether any data element could be considered personal information, all requirements of the _Privacy Act_ and Treasury Board Privacy Policies have been met in order to ensure user privacy is protected.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:215:Note that the list of data elements ([Appendix A](#appendix-a-list-of-covid-alert-app-data)), and consequently this assessment, is subject to change as the app is rolled out and adopted by provinces. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner will be consulted on any substantial modifications or updates that could impact this assessment. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:247:As mentioned, it is unlikely that any personal information will be collected about app users by the Government of Canada via the app, and the data that is collected is generally retained for a short period of time to support security measures and assess app effectiveness. In other words, all the information in this app’s ecosystem is designed to be kept for the shortest timeperiod necessary to achieve the specific need that information is for. If an individual receives a notice that they were in close proximity with someone who tested positive, but the individual who was notified had been in contact with very few people in the last two weeks, it is possible they would be able to identify who that individual is. There are other re-identification risks that may be possible, but they would be much more difficult to accomplish and therefore much more remote. The limited impact on individual’s privacy seems proportional to the great need to save lives, to ease restrictions on individuals thereby ameliorating the mental health of Canadians as well, and to allow the economy to safely re-open and rebuild.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:253:We note further that the alternative option, a contact tracing app, is more privacy invasive, collecting geolocation data and reporting this to public health authorities. In addition, manual contact tracing is highly resource-intensive and relies on individuals’ imperfect memory of where they have been for the past 14 days. It involves tracers tracking down individuals directly (typically by phone) to inform them of their risk of exposure and advising them of next steps. While manual contact tracing will continue, the supplementary capacity provided through the app allows for exposed individuals to be notified, without requiring the collection of personal information that is done during manual tracing. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:259:The app and the data collected therein will be used for the purpose of reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus in Canada. In addition, data, assessed to ensure it does not constitute personal information, will be used in order to monitor and measure the performance of the app. Further, any new use or disclosure of personal information can only be done with consent. Note that use of the Google/Apple API is conditional on any uses or disclosure of personal information being based upon consent. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:263:The app is unlikely to involve the collection of any personally identifiable information. The data collected via the app by the Government of Canada is limited and we have assessed that there is not a serious possibility of re-identification.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:271:The collection of aggregate, de-identified data and its retention period has been assessed to ensure it meets all requirements.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:275:Users who download the app will be required to review and accept a clear and accessible statement that provides them with information about how the app works, how information about exposure will be received by the user and transmitted to other users, what data will be collected about them and how that data will be used and where it will be stored. Our privacy analysis is publicly available.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:285:The app and its development is being implemented primarily by developers, designers, and researchers employed directly by the Government of Canada whose security clearance level is commensurate with the level of access they have. When external support is brought in on an advisory capacity (e.g., BlackBerry reviewing source code on a pro bono basis), it is without access to the system data. The code and infrastructure can be reviewed without providing any access to the data. When external support is brought in on a more hands-on capacity (e.g., developers with specialized mobile app or server infrastructure skills to ensure security and reliability at scale), those individuals will be under contract (either through procurement or through mechanisms like Interchange) which ensure they are held to the same standards as those employed directly by the Government of Canada. Security clearances will be required for anyone with access to sensitive infrastructure or data. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:287:In addition, the underlying cloud infrastructure that will host the key server (provided by Amazon Web Services and located in Canada) is procured through existing Shared Services Canada cloud framework agreements, subject to contractual terms to ensure access to data and systems is appropriately restricted. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:289:Procedural and technical safeguards are implemented, in accordance with the security assessment and authorization process, to ensure that only those with a need to access infrastructure or data can do so, and only for purposes linked to the implementation of the exposure notification system. The system is implemented according to the principle of “least privilege”: access to the data is treated as the exception, not the rule. Processes are in place, for example, to ensure that code is reviewed by multiple developers before being deployed, and access to the infrastructure is both controlled and monitored. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:293:## Appendix A: List of COVID Alert App Data
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:401:<li><strong>App</strong> would not collect personal health data, in any case

./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:494:*   Number of one-time keys (OTKs) entered into the app (by PT).<sup id="f11">[[11]](#server-data)</sup>
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:500:HC now collects the following data:
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:504:* **Number of users whose app changed to the “exposed” state:** When a user receives an exposure notification, the app status changes from “unexposed” to “exposed.” Each time this happens, the event would be logged and transmitted to the key server and aggregated to provide a total number of app users who received an exposure notification and the approximate number of exposure notifications sent. In addition, a separate event would be logged to provide a total number of users who received additional exposure notifications while their app was already in the “exposed” state. This data would also be cross-referenced with the selected PT to estimate the number of notifications received in each PT. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:506:* **Number of app users who enter a one-time key (OTK) after receiving an exposure notification:** If a user tests positive for COVID-19 and enters an OTK in the app while the app is in the “exposed” state, this would provide metrics on the approximate number of users who tested positive after receiving an exposure notification. This data would be cross-referenced with the selected PT to estimate the number of users who tested positive after receiving an exposure notification in each PT. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:520:### Data Collection Method
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:522:Data is collected from COVID Alert to develop the app metrics that enable HC to assess app effectiveness and performance. The data used to develop the app metrics are collected by creating event logs of user experiences and/or actions. These event logs are transmitted to the key server and will be accompanied by the IP address; however, the event logs and the IP address will not be linkable and will never be stored together. The data will be encrypted in transit and stored in two ways on the key server: 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:551:Given these circumstances, and the measures taken to protect the data (e.g., limiting the retention of individual event logs, aggregating event logs, storing the data separate from IP addresses, and storing the data on a secure server with limited access), the data are unlikely to constitute personal information. In other words, there is a less than frivolous chance that an individual could be identified alone, or in combination with other available information. Therefore, it is unlikely that the _Privacy Act_ would be engaged on the collection of these metrics. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:553:The primary risk is that the public _perceives_ the collection of the app metrics to be contrary to the privacy-protective approach taken in the design of the app. This will be mitigated by ensuring clear and transparent messaging about the additional data collection, the need for this data, and the privacy protections in place to reduce the risk of re-identification to near zero.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:557:The metrics will be used primarily for internal analysis and performance measurement. However, certain metrics, such as the number of installs in each PT and the number of exposure notifications sent, may be released publicly in aggregate form to demonstrate the effectiveness of the app and encourage app adoption. This data may also be released by individual PTs. A privacy assessment will be conducted to ensure that when any metrics are made publicly available, it is done in such a way that reduces the risk of re-identification to near zero. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:559:Health Canada will also consult with the OPC and the Advisory Council prior to the public release of app metrics data. In addition, the OPC, Advisory Council, and the Federal, Provincial, Territorial Working Group will continue to be consulted on the data collection prior to decisions being made and before implementation. Additional feedback will be considered to ensure that the data collection maintains the app’s privacy-protective approach.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:570:     Note that how this process will occur may vary from PT to PT. While the user experience may differ by PT, the data flow will not. [↩](#f3)

Bien que ces données ne soient pas téléversées au serveur, il est possible théoriquement de calculer le nombre des CET téléchargées par événement à partir du volume du téléchargement et, en faisant de l’ingénierie inverse, de dériver la date probable de l’apparition de symptômes ou du test au moyen de l’information et de l’horodatage des opérations informatiques. Même si une date probable est déduite par ingénierie inverse, le risque de réidentification demeure faible, car cela nécessiterait un effort et un accès de même niveau que ce qui serait nécessaire pour lier un diagnostic positif à une adresse IP particulière (on en traite plus à fond plus loin). Ajoutons que même si cela était réalisable, il est impossible de savoir de quelle date il s’agit : la date d’apparition de symptômes ou la date d’un test.

Some requested a blanket approval to share for all 13 days. This concern may have been due to the interface not being clear about why sharing for 13 days everyday instead of one ‘blanket’ upload was useful. One participant expected (from the onboarding screens) that he would share the 13 days in bulk.
