./covid-alert-documentation/AccessibilityReport.md:11:Conformance evaluation of this mobile appâ€™s accessibility incorporated a combination of semi-automated evaluation tools and manual evaluation by an experienced team of accessibility testers. It was also informed by accessibility related feedback from people with disabilities using both informal and formal methods. Inclusive design reviews were conducted with the product team to ensure best practices were being followed, and that insights from research were iterated on and presented within the app. The evaluation results in this report are based on evaluation conducted prior to launch. The app may have changed since that time. This document will be updated frequently to reflect the current status of the app.
