./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:14:* [6. Privacy Analysis](#6-privacy-analysis)
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:21:To assess the privacy implications of implementing a single national COVID-19 exposure notification application (app) based on the Google/Apple exposure notification application programming interface (API).        
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:25:This assessment will examine the privacy implications of the app, specifically in relation to the information/data that will be under the control of the Government of Canada, including the data that will be transmitted to the Government of Canada Server (key server). It will not examine any information under the control of the Provinces/Territories (PTs), such as the mechanism through which one-time keys are distributed to individuals for PTs who distribute one-time keys themselves.<sup id="f1">[[1]](#otp-portal)</sup> 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:31:In an effort to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while also gradually easing restrictions on individuals and allowing the economy to begin to re-open, the Government of Canada launched a single national COVID-19 exposure notification app (hereinafter referred to as COVID Alert) on July 31, 2020. It is interoperable across provinces and has been designed to minimize collection and storage of personally identifiable information. As a way to minimize risks to privacy, an exposure notification app, versus contact tracing app, was determined to be the preferred approach for establishing a Pan-Canadian digital solution to support efforts to reduce the spread of the virus.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:47:HC is charged with the overall implementation of the app. HC’s role involves engaging with the PTs to encourage buy-in and facilitate onboarding of the app. HC is also responsible for assessing any privacy implications and risks associated with the implementation of the app and engaging the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for meaningful consultation and feedback. Further, HC is executing a communications strategy to drive uptake of the app, supported by others.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:119:## 6\. Privacy Analysis
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:121:Our privacy analysis is in two parts. The first part examines whether there is a collection of personal information. The second part consists of an analysis of the app based on the privacy principles outlined in the [joint statement by Federal, Provincial and Territorial Privacy Commissioners issued May 7, 2020](https://priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/speeches/2020/s-d_20200507/). 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:145:PTs can also generate one-time keys using a healthcare portal operated by the Government of Canada. In this case, healthcare workers who have been authorized by the PT can log in to a secure portal, managed by CDS. This healthcare portal does not contain any patient data and is only used to generate one-time keys, which it retrieves via API from the key server. PTs are responsible for designating officials in their healthcare organizations who can serve as administrators of the portal and manage user accounts for their PT.<sup id="f8">[[8]](#healthcare-portal-privacy)</sup>
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:180:Refer to [Appendix B](#appendix-b-covid-alert-app-metrics) for an overview and privacy analysis on the collection of app metrics.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:192:We also acknowledge the position taken by multiple leading Privacy Regulators that assessing re-identification risk should look not only at the data itself, but also at the context in which the data are shared.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:209:In addition, the app metrics being collected by HC do not contain any direct identifiers. Individual logs will be stored for a short period, they will be compiled in the aggregate (total number of users/metric), and will not be combined with other information, including IP addresses (refer to [Appendix B](#appendix-b-covid-alert-app-metrics) for a privacy analysis of the app metrics). 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:213:Nevertheless, should a different conclusion be reached regarding the assessment of whether any data element could be considered personal information, all requirements of the _Privacy Act_ and Treasury Board Privacy Policies have been met in order to ensure user privacy is protected.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:215:Note that the list of data elements ([Appendix A](#appendix-a-list-of-covid-alert-app-data)), and consequently this assessment, is subject to change as the app is rolled out and adopted by provinces. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner will be consulted on any substantial modifications or updates that could impact this assessment. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:217:### Privacy Principles 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:241:Effectiveness of exposure notification apps is highly contingent on level of adoption; the more users that download the app, the more contacts it will be able to capture. While in the past countries have had difficulty achieving the needed user base, Apple and Google have now launched new technology for a privacy-first approach so that citizens can have confidence that their government is not collecting personally identifiable information. Coupled with a strong communications and marketing strategy, this is expected to significantly increase the number of users downloading the app than has been the case in countries that launched such programs in earlier phases of the pandemic. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:245:##### Is the loss of privacy proportional to the need?
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:247:As mentioned, it is unlikely that any personal information will be collected about app users by the Government of Canada via the app, and the data that is collected is generally retained for a short period of time to support security measures and assess app effectiveness. In other words, all the information in this app’s ecosystem is designed to be kept for the shortest timeperiod necessary to achieve the specific need that information is for. If an individual receives a notice that they were in close proximity with someone who tested positive, but the individual who was notified had been in contact with very few people in the last two weeks, it is possible they would be able to identify who that individual is. There are other re-identification risks that may be possible, but they would be much more difficult to accomplish and therefore much more remote. The limited impact on individual’s privacy seems proportional to the great need to save lives, to ease restrictions on individuals thereby ameliorating the mental health of Canadians as well, and to allow the economy to safely re-open and rebuild.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:249:##### Is there a less privacy-invasive way of achieving the same end?
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:253:We note further that the alternative option, a contact tracing app, is more privacy invasive, collecting geolocation data and reporting this to public health authorities. In addition, manual contact tracing is highly resource-intensive and relies on individuals’ imperfect memory of where they have been for the past 14 days. It involves tracers tracking down individuals directly (typically by phone) to inform them of their risk of exposure and advising them of next steps. While manual contact tracing will continue, the supplementary capacity provided through the app allows for exposed individuals to be notified, without requiring the collection of personal information that is done during manual tracing. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:255:For these reasons, the exposure notification app has been identified as a valuable supplement to manual tracing that is less resource-intensive and highly protective of Canadians’ privacy.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:275:Users who download the app will be required to review and accept a clear and accessible statement that provides them with information about how the app works, how information about exposure will be received by the user and transmitted to other users, what data will be collected about them and how that data will be used and where it will be stored. Our privacy analysis is publicly available.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:279:The performance of the app and its effectiveness will be closely monitored and assessed as more Canadians begin to use it. The Government of Canada is working closely with the Advisory Council to address any issues as they arise. The Advisory Council’s role is to provide expert advice and guidance to ensure the app meets the highest standards with respect to public health outcomes, technology, accessibility, and privacy. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:281:Health Canada is also developing a complementary oversight/accountability process for COVID Alert. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner is being engaged on assessments that may have impact on privacy. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:432:<li>Associated metadata: hour generated (rounded to hour to reduce privacy risk); validity period; transmission risk level (TBD how set/used, if at all); <em>API key</em> that generated the <em>one-time key</em> authorizing upload
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:547:### Privacy Analysis
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:551:Given these circumstances, and the measures taken to protect the data (e.g., limiting the retention of individual event logs, aggregating event logs, storing the data separate from IP addresses, and storing the data on a secure server with limited access), the data are unlikely to constitute personal information. In other words, there is a less than frivolous chance that an individual could be identified alone, or in combination with other available information. Therefore, it is unlikely that the _Privacy Act_ would be engaged on the collection of these metrics. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:553:The primary risk is that the public _perceives_ the collection of the app metrics to be contrary to the privacy-protective approach taken in the design of the app. This will be mitigated by ensuring clear and transparent messaging about the additional data collection, the need for this data, and the privacy protections in place to reduce the risk of re-identification to near zero.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:557:The metrics will be used primarily for internal analysis and performance measurement. However, certain metrics, such as the number of installs in each PT and the number of exposure notifications sent, may be released publicly in aggregate form to demonstrate the effectiveness of the app and encourage app adoption. This data may also be released by individual PTs. A privacy assessment will be conducted to ensure that when any metrics are made publicly available, it is done in such a way that reduces the risk of re-identification to near zero. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:559:Health Canada will also consult with the OPC and the Advisory Council prior to the public release of app metrics data. In addition, the OPC, Advisory Council, and the Federal, Provincial, Territorial Working Group will continue to be consulted on the data collection prior to decisions being made and before implementation. Additional feedback will be considered to ensure that the data collection maintains the app’s privacy-protective approach.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:564:     This analysis does not include a full privacy analysis of the distribution of one-time keys for PTs using the federal COVID Alert portal; however, it does provide a brief overview of the portal as well as a description of the information collected. The full privacy analysis for the portal was undertaken separately. [↩](#f1)

./covid-alert-documentation/README.md:43:In an effort to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while also gradually easing restrictions on individuals and allowing the economy to begin to re-open, the Government of Canada has committed to launching a single national COVID-19 exposure notification app (hereinafter referred to as COVID Alert). It will be interoperable across provinces and has been designed to minimize collection and storage of personally identifiable information. As a way to minimize risks to privacy, an exposure notification app, versus contact tracing app, was determined to be the preferred approach for establishing a Pan-Canadian digital solution to support efforts to reduce the spread of the virus.
./covid-alert-documentation/VulnerabilityDisclosurePolicy.md:35:*   We will treat your report in accordance with the _Access to Information Act_ and the _Privacy Act_.
./covid-alert-documentation/product/metrics.md:5:The COVID Alert app will soon start collecting metrics to help learn if the app is functioning as intended and about its impact on the pandemic. These metrics are aggregated and not tied to individual devices. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and the COVID Alert Advisory Council were consulted on the metrics and the collection method. COVID Alert continues to protect people&#39;s privacy.
./covid-alert-documentation/product/metrics.md:41:An app notification will notify COVID Alert users of a change to the [privacy notice](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert/privacy-policy.html), which will outline the new metrics the app is collecting upon launch. Full details will be found in the [COVID Alert Privacy Assessment](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert/privacy-policy/assessment.html) upon launch.
./covid-alert-documentation/product/qr-codes.md:5:COVID Alert aims to notify people when they may have been exposed to positive COVID-19 cases. Exposure to COVID-19 can happen via close contact with a COVID-positive individual or through aerosol or fomite transmission at venues where there is an outbreak, and the app currently only notifies people of close contact exposures. COVID Alert can support notifying people of outbreaks at places they’ve visited through scanning QR codes placed at participating venues while maintaining COVID Alert’s privacy-first principle. This work is based on venue outbreak capabilities in the UK and New Zealand’s exposure notification apps.
./covid-alert-documentation/product/qr-codes.md:13:It’s not. This feature works in much the same privacy-protecting way that the rest of COVID Alert does. The list of locations where a user “scanned in” is saved only on their phone, and is never uploaded to a server. The phone regularly downloads the list of all locations flagged as “outbreaks” by public health authorities, and checks for any matches. If there is a match, the user receives a notification. The Government of Canada never has access to app users’ scan history. 
./covid-alert-documentation/product/qr-codes.md:19:* Privacy is protected. No geolocation or other personally identifiable information of the app users will be shared with the Government of Canada, and users who scan QR codes don’t have to give their personal information to the venue.
./covid-alert-documentation/research/UsabilityAug2020.md:128:    *   It was good that the “nurse” asked if it was a good time. The speaker phone could present a privacy issue.
./covid-alert-documentation/research/UsabilityAug2020.md:146:    *   People noted that by the time they enter their key, it may be months after they have downloaded and onboarded onto the app. When they upload their codes, it may be a good opportunity to be reminded of the privacy implications of doing so.
