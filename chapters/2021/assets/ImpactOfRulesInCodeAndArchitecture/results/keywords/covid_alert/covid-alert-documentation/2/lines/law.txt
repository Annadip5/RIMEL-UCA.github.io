./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:159:IP addresses are stored in access logs on the AWS server, which is separate from the key server, for 3 months for all logs, and up to 24 months for those implicated in a security investigation, for cyber security systems to adequately understand, monitor, and respond to attacks against a system and for the secure and reliable operation of the service. Furthermore, IP addresses are not used by CDS to identify the source in any way, and they are not associated with any other data element in the server. The IP addresses are collected for security purposes. They are not used by the CDS-operated system to try to identify the source. IP addresses may be disclosed to law enforcement in the event a malicious actor attempted to gain, or gained, access to the server where they are stored. They would be deleted along with other data once the exposure notification system is shut down (i.e., once the pandemic is declared over), unless they are being retained for a security investigation.
