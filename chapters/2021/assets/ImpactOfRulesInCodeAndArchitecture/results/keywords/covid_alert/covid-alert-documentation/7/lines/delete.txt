./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:115:When an app user tests positive for COVID-19 in a PT that has adopted the app, they will obtain a one-time key that will be provided to them by their PT (how this occurs will depend on the PT). This key is provided to the PT by the Government of Canada and the Government of Canada has no way of knowing who that key is associated with (in other words who the person is who will receive this key). All the Government of Canada knows is that someone in a given PT tested positive for COVID-19. That said, the MOUs with the PTs who adopt the app will include requirements to safeguard the keys, to ensure they are only retained as long as necessary and to delete them once obtained by the app user.

./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:157:In the event the one-time key is not valid, the user’s IP address is retained at the key server level for [a rolling window of sixty minutes](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-shield-server/blob/d2f9cf605f73437d271a801db7acb87a6ce53db4/pkg/persistence/queries.go#L12-L15).

./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:159:IP addresses are stored in access logs on the AWS server, which is separate from the key server, for 3 months for all logs, and up to 24 months for those implicated in a security investigation, for cyber security systems to adequately understand, monitor, and respond to attacks against a system and for the secure and reliable operation of the service. Furthermore, IP addresses are not used by CDS to identify the source in any way, and they are not associated with any other data element in the server. The IP addresses are collected for security purposes. They are not used by the CDS-operated system to try to identify the source. IP addresses may be disclosed to law enforcement in the event a malicious actor attempted to gain, or gained, access to the server where they are stored. They would be deleted along with other data once the exposure notification system is shut down (i.e., once the pandemic is declared over), unless they are being retained for a security investigation.

Finally, the TEKs on the device delete after 14 days. In other words, all the information in this app’s ecosystem is designed to be kept for the shortest time period necessary to achieve the specific need that information is for.
