./covid-alert-documentation/AccessibilityReport.md:9:Based on this evaluation, the COVID Alert mobile app is close to meeting WCAG 2.1, Conformance Level AA. Detailed review results will be available shortly. Feedback on this evaluation is welcome.
./covid-alert-documentation/AccessibilityReport.md:11:Conformance evaluation of this mobile app’s accessibility incorporated a combination of semi-automated evaluation tools and manual evaluation by an experienced team of accessibility testers. It was also informed by accessibility related feedback from people with disabilities using both informal and formal methods. Inclusive design reviews were conducted with the product team to ensure best practices were being followed, and that insights from research were iterated on and presented within the app. The evaluation results in this report are based on evaluation conducted prior to launch. The app may have changed since that time. This document will be updated frequently to reflect the current status of the app.
./covid-alert-documentation/AccessibilityReport.md:40:*   **Testing with users:** We got feedback from real people who interact with the app.
./covid-alert-documentation/AccessibilityReport.md:54:*   Accessibility statement with community feedback.
./covid-alert-documentation/AccessibilityReport.md:55:*   Working to integrate accessibility and usability related feedback from beta.
./covid-alert-documentation/AccessibilityReport.md:66:We’re grateful for your feedback and insights. To tell us about accessibility issues in COVID Alert, please do one of the following:
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:47:HC is charged with the overall implementation of the app. HC’s role involves engaging with the PTs to encourage buy-in and facilitate onboarding of the app. HC is also responsible for assessing any privacy implications and risks associated with the implementation of the app and engaging the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for meaningful consultation and feedback. Further, HC is executing a communications strategy to drive uptake of the app, supported by others.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:157:In the event the one-time key is not valid, the user’s IP address is retained at the key server level for [a rolling window of sixty minutes](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-shield-server/blob/d2f9cf605f73437d271a801db7acb87a6ce53db4/pkg/persistence/queries.go#L12-L15). After fifty consecutive invalid attempts from the same IP, the IP is blocked for sixty minutes. The associated IP address is deleted from the system sixty minutes after the last invalid attempt to verify a one-time key. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:559:Health Canada will also consult with the OPC and the Advisory Council prior to the public release of app metrics data. In addition, the OPC, Advisory Council, and the Federal, Provincial, Territorial Working Group will continue to be consulted on the data collection prior to decisions being made and before implementation. Additional feedback will be considered to ensure that the data collection maintains the app’s privacy-protective approach.
./covid-alert-documentation/EvaluationViePriveeAlerteCOVID.md:157:Dans le cas où la clé unique n’est pas valide, l’adresse IP de l’utilisateur est conservée au niveau du serveur de clés pendant une [période continue de 60 minutes](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-shield-server/blob/d2f9cf605f73437d271a801db7acb87a6ce53db4/pkg/persistence/queries.go#L12-L15) (hyperlien en anglais seulement). Après cinquante tentatives invalides consécutives à partir de la même adresse IP, l’adresse IP est bloquée pendant soixante minutes. L’adresse IP connexe est supprimée du système soixante minutes après la dernière tentative non valide pour vérifier une clé unique.
