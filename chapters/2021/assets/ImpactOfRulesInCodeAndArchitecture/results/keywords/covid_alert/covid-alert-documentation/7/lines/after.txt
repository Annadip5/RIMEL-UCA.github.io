./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:31:In an effort to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while also gradually easing restrictions on individuals and allowing the economy to begin to re-open, the Government of Canada launched a single national COVID-19 exposure notification app (hereinafter referred to as COVID Alert) on July 31, 2020. It is interoperable across provinces and has been designed to minimize collection and storage of personally identifiable information. As a way to minimize risks to privacy, an exposure notification app, versus contact tracing app, was determined to be the preferred approach for establishing a Pan-Canadian digital solution to support efforts to reduce the spread of the virus.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:103:After entering a one-time key, the user will be asked if they have symptoms and, if yes, the date when their symptoms started. If the user is not sure if they have symptoms or are asymptomatic, they will be asked for their test date. The user can choose not to answer any of the questions.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:109:TEKs are generated once a day and expire after 14 days on the device. A TEK becomes a “diagnosis key” once released for upload to the key server. If the user consents to upload and transmit the diagnosis key, other users with whom they were in contact may receive a notification.<sup id="f6">[[6]](#dk-upload-next-steps)</sup> We note that if an individual has had contact with a very limited number of individuals in the past 14 days, it’s possible that the user who receives the notification may be able to associate it with an individual.<sup id="f7">[[7]](#limited-contact-scenario)</sup>
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:151:For the 14 days after a diagnosis key is inputted, the app does “know” that a person successfully inputted a valid one-time key. This is so they have the option of uploading their diagnosis keys for the 14 days following receipt of a positive diagnosis (as well as the days before their positive diagnosis – number of days will depend on whether they entered the date of symptom onset or date tested). In the unfortunate scenario where an individual who has COVID-19 cannot self-quarantine, this individual uploads their temporary exposure keys to the key server, which then makes them available to be downloaded by other users’ phones, and the app on those phones and the API layer then do the match up to determine, with respect to each of those phones, whether the phone, and thus its owner, has been in contact with the phone of the individual who has tested positive for COVID-19.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:157:In the event the one-time key is not valid, the user’s IP address is retained at the key server level for [a rolling window of sixty minutes](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-shield-server/blob/d2f9cf605f73437d271a801db7acb87a6ce53db4/pkg/persistence/queries.go#L12-L15). After fifty consecutive invalid attempts from the same IP, the IP is blocked for sixty minutes. The associated IP address is deleted from the system sixty minutes after the last invalid attempt to verify a one-time key. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:267:The app as a whole will be shut down within 30 days of a declaration by the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada that the pandemic is over.<sup id="f10">[[10]](#pandemic-criteria)</sup> As well, individuals can delete the app at any time. Finally, the TEKs on the device delete after 14 days. In other words, all the information in this app’s ecosystem is designed to be kept for the shortest time period necessary to achieve the specific need that information is for.
