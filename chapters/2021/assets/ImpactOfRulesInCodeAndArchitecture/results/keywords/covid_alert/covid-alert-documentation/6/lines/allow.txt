./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:31:In an effort to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, while also gradually easing restrictions on individuals and allowing the economy to begin to re-open, the Government of Canada launched a single national COVID-19 exposure notification app (hereinafter referred to as COVID Alert) on July 31, 2020. It is interoperable across provinces and has been designed to minimize collection and storage of personally identifiable information. As a way to minimize risks to privacy, an exposure notification app, versus contact tracing app, was determined to be the preferred approach for establishing a Pan-Canadian digital solution to support efforts to reduce the spread of the virus.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:99:When a one-time key is entered into the app, it will validate the key and ask the user if they would like their TEKs to be sent to the key server.<sup id="f4">[[4]](#dk-upload-process)</sup> If the individual says yes, the app communicates with the GAOS layer. The GAOS layer asks a second time whether the individual consents to sending their TEKs to the key server. If the individual consents, the TEKs are sent to the key server, allowing other users they have come in contact with in the past 14 days to be notified, once their app has downloaded these keys. App users also have the option of uploading their diagnosis keys for the 14 days _following_ receipt of a positive diagnosis, in the unfortunate scenario where an individual who has COVID-19 cannot self-quarantine (e.g. doesn’t have sick leave; lives alone and has to buy groceries, etc.). 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:147:As described in section 5, the one-time key exists for the purpose of allowing users (who are provided the key by their province) to upload their diagnosis keys to the server, acting as an anti-spam measure to ensure fake diagnosis keys are not accidentally or maliciously uploaded. The diagnosis keys are not associated with the one-time key or uploaded to the server along with the key. Once the key is entered in the app by the user, it is sent directly from the app to the key server, and it’s not retained in the app. The key server then checks to see if that one-time key is valid or not. If it’s valid, the key server erases its record of the one-time key and allows the app to upload the device’s diagnosis keys, with the user’s consent, by exchanging an encryption keypair with the app to ensure the diagnosis keys are encrypted in transit. Thus, as noted, the one-time key is not associated with the uploaded diagnosis keys. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:171:This feature was initially added at the request of Ontario, to prevent abuse of the system. Storing the HashID alongside the generated one-time key allows for PT systems to verify whether to issue a new one-time key or not—the PT system can see whether or not a previously provided one-time key had already been claimed. If a previously provided one-time key has not yet been claimed, then generating a new one-time key with the same HashID automatically invalidates the previous one-time key. If the previous one-time key was already claimed, a new key is not generated.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:235:The public goal of this pan-Canadian exposure notification app is to safely ease restrictions on freedom of movement and allow the economy to safely re-open while protecting the lives, health and well-being of everyone in Canada in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:237:This goal could be further facilitated by putting into place measures that allow some form of notification of exposure to the virus. Manual contact tracing is already taking place; however, it is hugely time-consuming and resource-intensive, and relies on individuals’ participation as well as their imperfect memory of where they have been for the past 14 days. An automated system to aid in informing individuals of COVID-19 exposure is a necessary element to safely easing restrictions and re-opening the economy.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:247:As mentioned, it is unlikely that any personal information will be collected about app users by the Government of Canada via the app, and the data that is collected is generally retained for a short period of time to support security measures and assess app effectiveness. In other words, all the information in this app’s ecosystem is designed to be kept for the shortest timeperiod necessary to achieve the specific need that information is for. If an individual receives a notice that they were in close proximity with someone who tested positive, but the individual who was notified had been in contact with very few people in the last two weeks, it is possible they would be able to identify who that individual is. There are other re-identification risks that may be possible, but they would be much more difficult to accomplish and therefore much more remote. The limited impact on individual’s privacy seems proportional to the great need to save lives, to ease restrictions on individuals thereby ameliorating the mental health of Canadians as well, and to allow the economy to safely re-open and rebuild.
./covid-alert-documentation/COVIDAlertPrivacyAssessment.md:253:We note further that the alternative option, a contact tracing app, is more privacy invasive, collecting geolocation data and reporting this to public health authorities. In addition, manual contact tracing is highly resource-intensive and relies on individuals’ imperfect memory of where they have been for the past 14 days. It involves tracers tracking down individuals directly (typically by phone) to inform them of their risk of exposure and advising them of next steps. While manual contact tracing will continue, the supplementary capacity provided through the app allows for exposed individuals to be notified, without requiring the collection of personal information that is done during manual tracing.

This can happen more quickly than calling every person.
